## Hi there 👋

My name is **Damon Chan**, and I live in **Tokyo**.  

I’ve been developing **Emacs plugins since 2019**, focusing on enhancing:  
- Reading experience  
- Book management  
- Language learning  
- Knowledge management  

These projects are actively maintained and I use them **every day**:  
- [**shrface**](https://github.com/chenyanming/shrface) – Enhance Emacs reading experience  
- [**calibredb.el**](https://github.com/chenyanming/calibredb.el) – Manage eBooks with Calibre  
- [**wallabag.el**](https://github.com/chenyanming/wallabag.el) – Save articles to Wallabag  
- [**paw**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw) – Emacs integration for text capture  
- [**paw_browser_extension**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw_browser_extension) – Chrome extension for Paw  

I am a **full-time solo developer**.  
If you enjoy my work, you can support me:  
- [Sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/chenyanming)  
- Buy me a coffee ☕  

Your support helps me **maintain and improve these projects sustainably**.  

Thank you!
