## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Damon Chan**, and I live in **Tokyo**.  

Iâ€™ve been developing **Emacs plugins since 2019**, focusing on enhancing:  
- Reading experience  
- Book management  
- Language learning  
- Knowledge management  

These projects are actively maintained and I use them **every day**:  
- [**shrface**](https://github.com/chenyanming/shrface) â€“ Enhance Emacs reading experience  
- [**calibredb.el**](https://github.com/chenyanming/calibredb.el) â€“ Manage eBooks with Calibre  
- [**wallabag.el**](https://github.com/chenyanming/wallabag.el) â€“ Save articles to Wallabag  
- [**paw**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw) â€“ Emacs integration for note taking and language learning
- [**paw_browser_extension**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw_browser_extension) â€“ Chrome extension for Paw  

I am a **full-time solo developer**.  
If you enjoy my work, you can support me:

Thank you!  

â€” Damon
