## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Damon Chan**.

Iâ€™ve been developing **Emacs plugins since 2019**, focusing on enhancing:  
- Reading experience  
- Book management  
- Language learning  
- Knowledge management  

These projects are actively maintained and I use them **every day**:

- [**calibredb.el**](https://github.com/chenyanming/calibredb.el) â€“ Manage eBooks with Calibre  
- [**wallabag.el**](https://github.com/chenyanming/wallabag.el) â€“ Save articles to Wallabag  
- [**paw**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw) â€“ Emacs integration for note taking and language learning
- [**paw_server**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw_server) - paw server eval commands on Emacs using emacsclient or org-protocol
- [**paw_browser_extension**](https://github.com/chenyanming/paw_browser_extension) â€“ Chrome/Firefox extension for eval Emacs commands or org-protocol on browser

I am a **full-time solo developer**.
