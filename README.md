My name is Damon Chan. I live in Tokyo.

I love programming, writing, and sharing thought-provoking ideasâ€”believing that only the ideas we truly live have real value. An Emacs hacker at heart and an entrepreneur in spirit, I turn curiosity into creation and ideas into impact.

I am also a blogger to share knowledge from my [homepage](https://elecming.com/). 

Support me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/chenyanming) or [email](mailto:elecming@gmail.com) me, I am happy to chat~
